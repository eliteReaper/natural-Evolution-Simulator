# Simulated Natural Simulation

In this world, there are Units they live on a grid with food scattered around and they have to survive by eating and reproducing in this world.

# Key Features
- The Units have certain speed, size and ability to sense food or other units around them, these qualities mutate and change overtime as the population grows.
- The Color of the Unit represents speed: 
  - Blue: Slower than base speed
  - Green: Equal to base speed
  - Red: Faster then base speed
- All these qualities require some energy and no Unit can have each one of them to its maximum extent.
- Larger Units can eat smaller Units and survive to see the next day.
- Eating a certain amount of food allows one Unit to reproduce and make an offspring with a mutated characteristic set (genome if u like).
- Only the fittest survive.

# How to run?
- Go to the root directory.
- Open terminal and run -> python ./animate.py, to animate the realtime population statistics.
- Run -> python ./testing.py, to run the simulation
- To change the constants like base speed, size or energy values(and much more) head onto CONSTANTS.py and change how you want to set up your world.
